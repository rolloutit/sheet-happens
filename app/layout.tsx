        Only the two Lexend subsets are preloaded, and both unconditionally. `@font-face` rules in a
        stylesheet are not fetched until the browser has matched them against laid-out text, so the
        body typeface would otherwise arrive a layout pass late. `latin-ext` is not gated on the HU
        locale because Hungarian names and project titles carry ő/ű inside the EN UI too.

        Poppins is deliberately left to on-demand discovery: it only dresses `.font-ui` labels, and
        preloading four more weights would compete with Lexend for the same early bandwidth.

        `crossOrigin` is required even though these are same-origin — CSS fetches fonts in anonymous
        CORS mode, so a preload without it is a cache miss the browser silently fetches twice.
