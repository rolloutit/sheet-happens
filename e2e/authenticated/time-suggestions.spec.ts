/**
 * Description suggestions on `/time` (`docs/time-entry-suggestions.md`).
 *
 * Three things are worth an end-to-end assertion rather than a component test, because all three
 * cross a boundary a component test cannot see:
 *
 *  - the list is **preloaded**: the server payload already carries this member's own descriptions,
 *    so focusing an empty field offers them with no round-trip and no keystroke;
 *  - accepting with `Enter` **does not submit**, all the way through the real form;
 *  - `Escape` closes the list and leaves the dialog open — the one behaviour that depends on how
 *    React delegates events in the App Router, which is a property of the running app.
 *
 * Everything asserted literally comes from the **frozen week**, never from the generated data.
 * That is also what makes the list itself predictable here: the suggestion window is 90 days back
 * from the *visible* week's end (`SUGGESTION_LOOKBACK_DAYS`), the frozen week sits at
 * `FROZEN_WEEK_START`, and the dev seed only generates entries from twelve months before today
 * forward — so on the frozen week the window contains the frozen entries and nothing else, and the
 * gap only widens as time passes. Even so no test names a description: each one reads what the
 * list actually offered and asserts what the field does with it, because the list is scoped to the
 * project the dialog opens on, and a literal would be pinning that choice rather than the feature.

 * Every test here needs a hydrated page, which the aria-snapshot specs do not. Run fully parallel,
 * all of them load `/time` in the same instant, and the Turbopack dev server leaves some of the
 * page's chunk requests hanging (the failure `visit` in fixtures.ts describes): the page renders,
 * never hydrates, and `New entry` never gets a handler however often it is clicked. In order, each
 * one hydrates in about a second. The budget is `time.spec.ts`'s reasoning for its own navigation
