 * identifier are all built from them, and re-deriving them from `process.env` in a second place is
 * how they drift apart.
 *
 * These are deliberately *static* strings. Better Auth's `baseURL` is a dynamic config outside
 * production (see `authBaseURLConfig` in `auth.ts`), which leaves `(await auth.$context).baseURL`
 * empty there — so anything that needs a URL at module scope has to come from here instead.
